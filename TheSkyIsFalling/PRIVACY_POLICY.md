## The Sky is Falling: Privacy Policy

This is the privacy policy for the exiting game - The Sky is Falling!

The simplest summary of this privacy policy is that this app does not collect any data about the user and, obviously, does not share any data. It does take advantage of the Google Play Games High Scores facility, but all that data is collected and stored by Google.

### Data collected by the app

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data (app preferences) created by the you (the user) is stored locally in your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it. No analytics software is present in the app either.

### Explanation of permissions requested in the app

The list of permissions required by the app can be found in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

| Permission | Why it is required |
| :---: | --- |
| 'android.permission.INTERNET' | Required to allow users to benefit from Google Play Game services. |
| 'android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE' | REquired to support tha above interet access. |

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please post a discussion on GitHub, and I will surely try to fix it/help you.
